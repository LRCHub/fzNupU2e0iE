Okay, okay, okay

I'm 'bout to have a good day
No matter what they say
The sun is shining down on me
Birds are singing praise
I'm 'bout to have a good
In every single way
The God who made the universe knows me by my name
So it's a good day

Baby in my arms walking through the neighbourhood
Living in the present, not would've, should've or could
I remember back when I was low as a rug
Now I'm standing up, look at what my Father does

Turning old things new, grey skies blue
Hear the church saying "Won't He do it"
I know He's got my back
That's why I'm singing that

I'm 'bout to have a good day
No matter what they say
The sun is shining down on me
Birds are singing praise
I'm 'bout to have a good
In every single way
The God who made the universe knows me by my name
So it's a good day

It's a good day, mmm no, it's great
Everything I prayed for didn't come in late
I got all I need, and I didn't have to wait
Ask me if You love me, You didn't hesitate

Turning old things new, grey skies blue
Hear the church saying "Won't He do it"
I know He's got my back
That's why I'm singing that

I'm 'bout to have a good day
No matter what they say
The sun is shining down on me
Birds are singing praise
I'm 'bout to have a good
In every single way
The God who made the universe knows me by my name
So it's a good day

Na-na-na-na (good day)
Na-na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na-na, it's a good day
Na-na-na-na (good day)
Na-na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na-na, it's a good day

Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na-na
It's a good day
